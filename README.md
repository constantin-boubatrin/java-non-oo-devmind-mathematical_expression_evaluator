# Mathematical Expression Evaluator

I implemented a well-known algorithm for evaluating mathematical expressions that
can handle complex calculations, ensuring the proper order of operation is observed.
The implementation is efficient and accurate, and was developed using Java.

The evaluation algorithm contains 2 stages:
1. Conversion of mathematical expressions specified in infix notation
to the postfix notation, also known as the Reverse Polish Notation (RPN),
using the Shunting-yard algorithm (stack-based algorithm), which belongs
to one of the most influential researchers in Mathematics and
Computer Science: Edsger W. Dijkstra.
2. Evaluation of Postfix Expression using Stack.

This project allowed me to hone my skills in algorithmic thinking,
problem-solving, and attention to detail.
